### Design Choices
#### Font
  [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) is a clean and modern font that's perfect for any website. It's easy to read on screens of all sizes, making it ideal for web and mobile use.
#### Icons
  I use [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons because they're easy to use and look great. After adding them to the site, it became livelier and more attractive. Thanks to them, the website is easier to read. They are easy to understand, so they replace some descriptions.
